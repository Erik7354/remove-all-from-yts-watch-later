# Remove all Videos from YouTubes Watch-later playlist

Is your Watch-later playlist also full of videos you added years ago and didn't remember once? 
If the answer is yes, this script is for you!

Just copy the code into your browser console and press enter.

One notice: I made this in January.2022 so in case YouTube changes it's websites source code this script might not work as intended anymore. No warranty for anything that happend because of that.
